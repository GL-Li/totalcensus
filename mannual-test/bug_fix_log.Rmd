```{r}

```

# read_acs5() unable to read metro data, 20181205 

This is a bug to v0.5.0, which yield zero rows of data for the following code:
```{r}
home_ny <- read_acs5year(
    year = 2016,
    states = "NY",
    table_contents = "home_value = B25077_001",
    #areas = "New York metro",
    geo_headers = "CBSA",
    summary_level = "block group",
    dec_fill = "dec2010"
)
```

Solution: add a parameter `dec_fill`, which allows to fill code of geoheaders with decennial census 2010 data.
